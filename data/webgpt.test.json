[1]  When a person dies from hyponatremia as a result of water intoxication, the initiating factor is a severe **sodium imbalance** that causes massive cell damage. Sodium is a positively charged ion, and its role in the body is to circulate the fluids outside of cells. As a result, sodium helps regulate blood pressure and maintain the signals that let muscles operate properly, among other things. Cells actively maintain a precise sodium concentration in the body.

However, this method is not effective for dinosaur bones because the half-life of carbon-14 is only ~5730 years [1]. The second method is by using uranium-238, uranium-235, and potassium-40 isotopes, each of which has a half-life of more than a million years [1]. Unfortunately, these elements don't exist in dinosaur fossils themselves, but each of them typically exists in igneous rock, which is rock made from cooled magma [2]. However, igneous rock isn't usually found in the same rock layers as sedimentary rock, which is where dinosaur fossils are found [2]. Therefore, to approximate the age of sedimentary rock layers, researchers have to find layers of earth that include igneous rock, such as volcanic ash, which are like bookends and can help pin down the age of the sedimentary layers between them [2].", "## Human:\nHow do scientists determine the age of dinosaur bones?\n\nis it 100% accurate or more of a guess? please explain like I'm 5.\n\n## Assistant:\nThere are several different methods that scientists can use to determine the approximate age of dinosaur bones.

However, in a reactor there are other things that start and sustain the chain reaction, such as a moderator [1]. In all commercial reactors in the United States, the moderator is plain old water [1]. Some reactors use heavy water and others use graphite [1]. Either way, the function is critical for (most) nuclear reactors [1]. When a U-235 nucleus absorbs an extra neutron, it quickly breaks into two parts, which is known as fission [2]. Each time a U-235 nucleus splits, it releases two or three neutrons, which allows for a chain reaction [2]. The rate of fissions in the uranium nuclei in the MIT reactor is controlled by control blades of boron-stainless steel which are inserted vertically alongside the fuel elements [3]. Boron has the property of absorbing neutrons without re-emitting any, so when the control blades are fully inserted, they absorb so many neutrons from the uranium that there aren't enough to allow a chain reaction to continue [3].

Typically, this involves the introduction of a hybrid species, like in the case of the Florida panther. In this example, scientists were able to introduce cougars into the population to breed with the panthers, thus helping the population become stable and genetically healthy again [3]. However, the threespine sticklebacks did not have much success with hybridization, and both of the original species went extinct [3]. This means their roles in the lake ecosystem are no longer being fulfilled, thus changing the lake [3].", "## Human:\nWill species that are endangered recover over time because of evolution?\n\nI.E will sharks that are endangered no longer be endangered if we give them long enough to adapt and maybe begin to avoid humans at all costs?\n\n## Assistant:\nSharks have evolved over time in response to selective pressures such as changing habitat and hunting by other organisms.

For instance, a function that is constant inside the interval and zero elsewhere is called a rectangular window, which describes the shape of its graphical representation [2]. When another function or a signal (data) is multiplied by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap; the \"view through the window\" [2]. In typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, \"bell-shaped\" curves [3]. Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used [3].", "## Human:\nThe really simple version of windowing\n\nSo my trainwreck of a DSP class hasn't really been going well for me, it seems like the professor doesn't provide any context for what we are learning and it would be a better use of my time to just copy articles from wikipedia.

High-resolution, low-dynamic-range windows such as the rectangular window also have the property of high **sensitivity**, which is the ability to reveal relatively weak sinusoids in the presence of additive random noise. That is because the noise produces a stronger response with high-dynamic-range windows than with high-resolution windows. [1]\n\nAt the other extreme of the range of window types are windows with high dynamic range but low resolution and sensitivity. High-dynamic-range windows are most often justified in wideband applications, where the spectrum being analyzed is expected to contain many different components of various amplitudes.

When the observer is moving towards the source, the frequency gets higher (approach), and when the observer is moving away from the source, the frequency gets lower (recession) [1][2].

It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who described the phenomenon in 1842. [1][2] A common example of Doppler shift is the change of pitch heard when a vehicle sounding a horn approaches and recedes from an observer. Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession.  The reason for the Doppler effect is that when the source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the crest of the previous wave. Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Hence, the time between the arrivals of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency.

Cold temperatures can lead to dehydration of mucus and dry nostrils and airways, which could make it easier for the viruses to make themselves at home once they're passed to us [1]. Additionally, humans and many other mammals experience seasonal physiological changes, often tied to the light/dark cycle [4]. In the winter, any number of tweaks to our immunity - such as a decrease in vitamin D production - could make us more susceptible to the virus [4]. One interesting theory is that the reason we get sick more often in the winter is because cold weather leads to our blood vessels in our nose constricting, which reduces our ability to fight infection [5].", "## Human:\nWhy does being cold make us catch a cold?\n\n[removed]\n\n## Assistant:\nThe human body goes through seasonal physiological changes tied to the light/dark cycle [2].

However, there are other factors that come into play in the winter as well. Cooler body temperatures cause the blood vessels in our nose and upper airways to constrict, which is what researchers believe inhibits our immune response and triggers cold symptoms [3].

[1]  Another theory is that humans have evolved to cry in order to relieve stress and reduce the levels of stress hormones in the body.  If this theory is correct, then crying could serve as an adaptive function in response to stress, in the same way that sweating helps cool us down when we are overheated.

We have retained from the Babylonians not only hours and minutes divided into 60, but also their division of a circle into 360 parts or degrees [1]. The definition of a day is the amount of time it takes an astronomical object to complete one full spin on its axis [2]. A day is 23 hours and 56 minutes, but other planets and bodies rotate at different rates [2]. This means that a day on the Moon is about 14 Earth days long and a \"night\" lasts the same time [2].

The Moon is gradually slowing the Earth's rotation because of friction produced by tides [1]. Over the course of a century, the length of a day increases by a couple of milliseconds [1]. However, 24 hours is the length of one Earth day on average [2]. The Earth's actual motion around the Sun varies from a low of 29.3 km/s to a high of 30.3 km/s, which factors in to the length of our days varying by about ±4 seconds throughout the year [3]. The day is defined to be the time between one dawn (or noon) and the next, meaning the day is defined with respect to the position of the Sun in the sky [4].

These cables can carry telephone conversations, audio signals, and digital data [1]. In order to transmit this information, the analog voice signals are first translated into digital signals [1]. A laser at one end of the pipe switches on and off to send each bit of information [1]. The information is then transmitted down the line by equipment in huts every 40 to 60 miles [2]. The huts contain equipment that picks up and retransmits the signal down the next segment at full strength [2]. Light travels down the cable by bouncing off the walls of the cable repeatedly [3]. Each photon bounces down the pipe like a bobsleigh going down an ice run [3, 4]. If light hits glass at a shallow angle, it reflects back in again, in a phenomenon called total internal reflection [4]. This keeps the light inside the pipe [4].", "## Human:\nHow do fibre optic cables actually work?\n\nThe extent of my knowledge of fibre optic cables is simply that they carry light as forms of information.

The electronic signals that travel down the inner tube of the cable are in the form of bursts of light [3]. These signals travel down the core of the cable at a shallow angle, causing the light to bounce off the walls of the core rather than shine right through the glass [3]. This is known as total internal reflection and keeps the light signal from leaking out of the core [3].

Building a hexagonal honeycomb actually offers the most space using the least amount of wax.

In this case, sound could leave an interstate or highway, go up into the atmosphere, and then be bent back down to the surface toward the cooler air, making the sound louder and allowing it to be heard from farther away [2]. Another way weather may affect noise levels is through changes of the surface conditions over which the sound is propagating [3].

Car motors are mass produced in their thousands and every one of them will be sold. Outboard motors are less common and so fewer of these will be sold. For this reason they will always be more expensive. [1]\n\nAnother reason people state is that outboard motor manufacturers include colossal research and development costs in their products. Since they’re spending a lot of time and money in this domain, they expect something in return from the customers. Adding to the final price of the product ensures that the research and development process continues. [2]\n\nMany modern boats come with an outboard motor as a standard.

This reduction in stress hormones results in lower heart rate, lower blood pressure, slowed breathing, and relaxing of muscles [2]. A study done by the Massage Research Laboratory found that a single deep-tissue Swedish massage resulted in a significant decrease in the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) compared to a control treatment of light-touch therapy [3]. AVP constricts blood vessels, raises blood pressure, and reduces excretion of urine [3]. This study suggests that massage also produces reductions in levels of cortisol, a hormone released when you’re stressed, as well as increases in lymphocytes, cancer-fighting white blood cells [3].", "## Human:\nWhy do massages feel so damn good?\n\n\n\n## Assistant:\nOne reason massages feel so good is that the therapist's touch causes an immediate reaction in your brain [1]. When your skin's nerve cells feel pressure, they signal the brain to release feel-good chemicals called endorphins, which boost your mood and give you a natural high [1]. Additionally, massages stimulate vagal activity [2]. When the vagus nerve is stimulated via skin receptors, heart rate decreases, blood pressure drops, and cortisol production slows down [2]. The body becomes primed for relaxation and sleep, which explains why some people doze off during treatment [2]. Another way that massages are beneficial to the body is that they specifically promote and assist with blood circulation to the body [3]. When we have an opportunity to relax and we have someone working out those knots, kinks, and tight muscles, the circulatory system starts moving again and the nutrients from our blood are sent back into those muscles [4]. Massage can also be viewed as a painkiller because it activates the same part of the brain that is activated by opioid painkillers such as codeine [5]."], "score": [1.0, 1.0]}, {"text": ["## Human:\nHow does Mosquito repellent work?\n\n\n\n## Assistant:\nMost mosquito repellents work by evaporating on the skin and creating a vapor barrier a few inches above the area of application, usually by using a combination of a carrier solvent and the repellent itself [2][3]. This vapor barrier confuses insects so they can't locate a target host [2]. In the case of mosquito repellents, the carrier solvent is usually alcohol, and the repellent is usually a combination of diethyltoluamide (DEET) and another ingredient such as icaridine [1][2][3]. The effectiveness of mosquito repellents can be affected by a variety of factors including the concentration of the repellent, the insect species being targeted, and the environment in which the repellent will be used [2][3]. Furthermore, some ultrasonic or sonic repellants are battery-powered or plug-in devices that are meant to repel mosquitoes by emitting sounds [3]. However, these devices have not been scientifically proven to work, nor are the sounds proven to scare away female mosquitoes [3]. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission charged one manufacturer with making false and unsubstantiated claims because it had no evidence supporting the product claims [3].", "## Human:\nHow does Mosquito repellent work?\n\n\n\n## Assistant:\nMost mosquito repellents work by affecting a mosquito's sense of smell or taste, preventing it from finding a host to feed on [1,2].

The structure of the feather develops as proteins get deposited around the surface of the bump of skin, where branching patterns form [1]. These branches then fuse near the base to make thicker barbs [1]. Once the feather is fully grown, it stops growing and the bird molts, or grows a new set of feathers [3, 4].", "## Human:\nHow do feathers grow?\n\nIs it more or less the same as how mammals grow hair?\n\n## Assistant:\nFeathers grow from a small outgrowth of skin called a papilla [1,2].

As the feather grows, proteins are laid down around the surface of the papilla, forming the feather's structure [1,2]. Smaller branches fuse at the base to make thicker ones, and barbules branch off the secondary branches off a feather barb to form the main branches off the central shaft of a feather and then barbules fuse into a rachis, which is the stiff central shaft of a feather from which barbules branch [1,2].

The first way is through relative dating. Relative dating places events or rocks in their chronologic sequence or order of occurrence. This means that if a rock is found above another rock, then it is younger than the rock below it. Absolute dating places events or rocks at a specific time. If a geologist claims to be 45 years old, that is an absolute age.  Geologists typically know the age of a rock by determining the age of the group of rocks, or formation, that it is found in. The age of formations is marked on a geologic calendar known as the geologic time scale. [3][4] The geologic time scale was developed long after the relative time scale was worked out from fossils. [1] This scale involves radioactivity. Some minerals contain atoms of the radioactive chemical element uranium. Now and then, an atom of uranium self-destructs to form an atom of lead. Scientists know the rate of self-destruction. They grind up a rock to collect tiny grains of minerals that started out containing some uranium but no lead. Then they use a very sensitive instrument, called a mass spectrometer, to measure how much of the uranium has been changed to lead.", "## Human:\nHow do we know how old rocks are?\n\nhow do we know scientific methods to find out the ages of rocks and the earth are 100% fact? thanks. \n\n## Assistant:\nIt's possible to date rocks using three different kinds of arguments: Lord Kelvin and his allies used the first of these to refer to the rate of heat loss from the earth and the length of time it would have taken to form its solid crust [2].

The third referred to the heat of the sun, particularly the rate at which such heat is being lost, compared with the total amount of energy initially available [2]. Volcanic rocks typically contain naturally radioactive minerals, so we can date these minerals using techniques based on the radioactive decay of isotopes [3]. This relies on the radioactive decay of uranium, so it can be used to date rocks containing the oldest known fossils on Earth [4]."], "score": [1.5, 0.5]}, {"text": ["## Human:\nwhy it's colder in Utah than Washington, even though Washington is farther up north.\n\nI live in Utah, and for some reason I was looking at Washington's weather.

For hurricanes, this usually happens when they move over land or cold water [1, 2]. Moving over land provides more friction, which disrupts the storm and causes it to fail [3]. In the case of tornadoes, they usually \"die\" down when they run out of warm, moist air, resulting in dry air invading the tornado and causing it to weaken [5].", "## Human:\nWhy/how is it that tornadoes and hurricanes \"die\" down instead of just continuously growing larger?\n\n\n\n## Assistant:\nHurricanes lose power when they move over land because they no longer have access to the warm water and moisture from the ocean, which is a necessity for them to grow [1, 4, 5]. They also lose the heat energy from the ocean, which is another main source of fuel for them [4, 5]. Another reason is friction with the land. When a hurricane is over water, the wind speed is almost completely unreduced by the Coriolis effect [3]. However, when it makes landfall, the wind speed drops, the Coriolis effect is reduced, and the winds gradually spiral inward, causing the intense low air pressure at the center of the hurricane to start filling [3, 5]. As the pressure at the center rises, the force caused by pressure differences drops, which causes the wind speed to drop [3, 5].

As a result, ray-traced graphics can produce shadows with soft, smooth edges—especially when there’s more than one light source in the scene.

Then imagine shooting many rays, using the ones that do (and don’t) return to figure out how the scene should look.

The hibernating animal becomes completely immobile, falling into a coma-like state [1].

This theory states that external factors such as toxins, infections, stress, sun damage, pollution, and smoking speed up the production of free radicals. As we age, the cumulative damage to the mitochondria makes them less efficient at turning fuel into energy, and the number of mitochondria per cell reduces [3]. Other factors include a decrease in the ability to turn protein into energy, and not getting enough calories or protein to sustain muscle mass [4, 5]. A decline in nerve cells, hormone levels, and the ability to synthesize muscle proteins also contribute to sarcopenia, or age-related decrease in muscle mass and function [4, 5].", "## Human:\nwhy you have so much less energy and get sore much easier/recover slower and longer as you age?\n\nWhat is it about being a teenager that makes you energetic and rarely know what truly being sore is, where as someone 20, 30 years older wears out much faster, and stays sore much longer?

The round molds provide extra strength in pressing, where rectangular molds of the same thickness tend to lose their shape and even split at the seams over time [1]. Today, the shape of a cheese is often dependent on the type of cheese and the producer [2, 3]. For instance, creamy cheeses like Brie and Camembert need equal rates of salt uptake and even ripening action from its molds as they break down the milk proteins and produce the delicious ambrosia within. The wheel shape facilitates both as the consistent thickness encourages equal absorption as the surface flora spreads [3].", "## Human:\nWhy are some cheeses made into wheels but others in blocks?\n\n\n\n## Assistant:\nCheeses that are made in wheels need to have even rates of salt uptake and even ripening action from its molds.

Research has found that men are particularly attracted to breathy female voices, which tend to have a larger gap between the vocal cords, which the air passes through as they speak [1, 2, 3, 5]. This larger gap causes the air to whistle through as they speak, which makes their voice sound breathy [2, 3]. Men tend to agree strongly about which voices are attractive, but have trouble pinpointing exactly what it is about a voice that turns them on [3]. Looking at formant dispersion, which refers to the range of frequencies our voice usually hits, it has been found that the broader the range, the \"fuller\" the voice, and thus the more attractive the voice is to men [3].

Another factor is general polarization: the whole nation is becoming more ideologically polarized, Pew has found, and lots of reasons have been proposed for why that polarization may have happened: distrust in government, the racial and religious politics of the 1960s and 70s, even income inequality [2]. If highly educated people are (for a variety of reasons) simply more predisposed to being ideologically consistent (or more accurately here, more consistently liberal), that may mean they were particularly affected by the forces of polarization over the last 20 years [3]. Also, a Pew study indicates that the most highly educated professionals are coming to form, if not a new class, at least a reliably liberal political grouping [4]. One reason for this is that highly educated people are more likely to be exposed to differing opinions in college that make them question their previously held beliefs [4].", "## Human:\nWhy is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing.

By doing this, we reduce the amount of light that can enter our eyes at once, thereby avoiding the discomfort or painful sensation that comes from seeing too much bright light at once. [3]  By limiting the rays of light that come in through the bottom and top of the pupil, squinting allows rays to pass closer to the center of the lens, thereby creating a more focused image.

As the simple approach to hex-reading doesn’t work here, the program is opened in the dissembler to understand the code of the game. The dissembler shows the code line by line. The strings used in the program show string references, which is how a person can find the message that was shown upon entering an incorrect serial key. The programmer then uses this message to find the serial key the game is looking for and thus crack the game.

[1]  This method works by examining the area of the game where the user enters the serial key and seeing if the game will let the user enter an invalid key.  [1]  If the game does give an error message when an invalid key is entered, the hex-reading method can be used to identify a possible key by searching the hexadecimal code for the message. [1]  An even more invasive form of cracking is known as disassembling, which involves taking the game programming code and rewriting it to think that the user has entered a valid key when in fact they have not. [3]  This is often accomplished by re-writing the program to look for the same invalid key over and over until the game totally crashes. [3]  Finally, a last method of cracking is known as patching.  Patching involves finding a loophole in the games programming code and providing a patch that will allow the user to circumvent the games security.

This phenomenon is called total internal reflection.

It is current technology and I am not sure how it changes UV Rays into electricity.\n\n## Assistant:\n Solar panels work by using photovoltaic cells to absorb photons, or particles of light, and convert them into electricity [1,4]. The cells are essentially semiconducting sandwiches made up of two slices of silicon. The top layer has extra electrons, giving it a negative charge, while the bottom layer has fewer electrons, giving it a positive charge. Electric field is established when the electrons at the junction between the silicon layers are pushed out when a photon bumps into an electron [2,3]. This electron is then ejected from the silicon junction [3]. Solar panels consist of many smaller units called photovoltaic cells [1,4]. When sunlight hits a solar panel, photons knock electrons free from atoms, thus creating an electric field that pushes the electrons out of the silicon junction [1,2,3]. The electrons then flow through the home's electrical panel and are distributed accordingly [4,5].", "## Human:\nHow do solar panels work?\n\nJust wondering how solar panels work.

When photons from the sunlight beat down on these cells, they knock the electrons off the silicon [1]. This creates an electrical charge, and because the electrons are free to move, electricity flows [4].

Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\n## Assistant:\nUltraviolet B radiation (wavelength 280-315 nanometers) penetrates through the skin, converting 7-DHC into an isomer of vitamin D3 called preD3 [1]. The final stage, isomerization, or converting preD3 into vitamin D3 is dependent on the temperature within the skin. To keep the reaction going, a protein—the descriptively named vitamin D binding protein—binds to the newly created vitamin D3 and transports it into the blood, via capillaries located where the epidermis meets the lower skin layer, the dermis [1]. If D3, the product of the isomerization, becomes overconcentrated, the reaction may be forced into equilibrium, stopping vitamin D3 synthesis. Vitamin D binding protein ensures that synthesis proceeds as efficiently as possible [1]. At temperatures at or near body temperature, the reaction can proceed for around three days, continuing even after sun exposure ends [1]. Moderate sun exposure is sufficient to produce enough vitamin D3, assuming otherwise good health and nutrition [1].", "## Human:\nHow does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D?

This concept can be explained as the movement of electrons between shells, or even at the level of protons and neutrons within a nucleus [1]. In practice, it is quite impractical to convert the rest energy of matter entirely into other forms of energy [3]. Nonetheless, a small fraction of rest energy is converted in chemical and nuclear reactions [3]. For instance, if hydrogen is burned in oxygen, the product is water plus heat and light [3]. This means that the process of burning converted chemical energy into heat and light [3]. However, if measurements are made, it is found that the mass of the water is slightly less than the sum of the masses of the original hydrogen and oxygen [3].

This phenomenon was demonstrated accurate to 0.0004% in 2005 [1]. Furthermore, if this gamma ray is absorbed by a different atom, it will cause the atom's mass to increase [1]. The extent of conversion between matter and energy is governed by the famous relativistic energy equation E=mc^2 [3].

[1]", "## Human:\nHow do muscles get stronger as you workout?\n\n[removed]\n\n## Assistant:\nMuscle cells undergoing regular bouts of exercise followed by periods of rest with sufficient dietary protein undergo hypertrophy as a response to the stress of training. Cells subjected to this process undergo enlargement, which enhances their ability to deliver force. [1] The neural basis of muscle strength enhancement primarily involves the ability to recruit more muscle cells--and thus more power strokes--in a simultaneous manner, a process referred to as synchronous activation. This is in contradistinction to the firing pattern seen in untrained muscle, where the cells take turns firing in an asynchronous manner. Training also decreases inhibitory neural feedback, a natural response of the central nervous system to feedback signals arising from the muscle. Such inhibition keeps the muscle from overworking and possibly ripping itself apart as it creates a level of force to which it is not accustomed. This neural adaptation generates significant strength gains with minimal hypertrophy and is responsible for much of the strength gains seen in women and adolescents who exercise. [2]  Finally, after you workout, your body repairs or replaces damaged muscle fibers through a cellular process where it fuses muscle fibers together to form new muscle protein strands or myofibrils. These repaired myofibrils increase in thickness and number to create muscle hypertrophy (growth).

What is happening chemically in the brain to be able to relate the differences?\n\n\n\n## Assistant:\nWhen you stretch a muscle, your body responds by increasing blood flow to that area. The blood vessels around the targeted muscle widen to allow more blood to flow through, and your heart starts pumping more blood.  This increase in blood flow allows the muscle or muscles you’re stretching to receive more oxygen and to get rid of metabolic waste products. [1] \nStretching also triggers a release of endorphins.  Your body’s natural reward system makes stretching feel good to motivate you to keep your muscles at optimal tension. [3]  Stretching also clears your mind and allows you to focus on your body. [4]  Research has shown that static stretching activates your parasympathetic nervous system and inhibits activation of your sympathetic nervous system.  Your parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for your rest and digestion functions. It can also help induce feelings of calmness and relaxation.

When we push air out forcefully, the brain transmits a signal to the muscle group in question that either decreases inhibition or excites it [1]. The end result is the \"oomph factor\" that makes us exert ourselves more forcefully [1].
